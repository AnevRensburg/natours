# Natours

[View the demo](https://anevrensburg.github.io/natours/)

This Natours project was created during Jonas Schmedtmann's [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) course. Regrettably, I didn't complete the course, and my work on this project concluded in November 2021.

**Key concepts I learned in this project include:**
- Modern CSS techniques
- Advanced CSS animations
- Essential CSS selectors
- CSS architecture
- Practical Sass usage
